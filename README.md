# manufacturing industry project introduction:
In this project, four time series related to the manufacturing industry were provided, including job openings, layoffs, employees, and spending. We began by importing the data and converting it to time series format. Next, we visually inspected the time series using autoplot and noticed that the openings contained a seasonal pattern with a gradual increase in trend over time. We then proceeded to fit six different models to the data and examined their assumptions and performance.

Models include Linear Regression, Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL),  Seasonal Trend Decomposition using exponential smoothing (ETS), Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR), Vector Autoregression (VAR), and ARIMA. Also a final result using weighted average.
