# Manufacturing Industry Project Introduction:
This project provided four time series related to the manufacturing industry, including job openings, layoffs, employees, and spending. We began by importing the data and converting it to time series format. Next, we visually inspected the time series using autoplot and noticed that the openings contained a seasonal pattern with a gradual increase in trend over time. We then proceeded to fit six different models to the data and examined their assumptions and performance.

Models include Linear Regression, Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL),  Seasonal Trend Decomposition using exponential smoothing (ETS), Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR), Vector Autoregression (VAR), and ARIMA, and a final prediction using weighted average.

# Product Project Introduction:
The dataset has 100+ products over 4 years. I need to find out some essential products and their categories and forecast the sales in the next year. After the preprocessing and data cleaning, I did some simple data analysis to quickly locate top-sale products and high growth rate products. I also plot the correlation for the products under the same category for vector autoregression in the next step.

I built models including Vector autoregression (VAR), ARIMA, STL, and their average for several single important products.
